Manage Cliniko stock levels across multiple locations

The stock module within Cliniko only records total stock levels. For businesses that only manage a single stock location, this is not an issue; however businesses that have stock distributed across several locations currently have to track this information external to Cliniko. This app aims to add this functionality to Cliniko by creating a set processes that store and manage these additional data points.
